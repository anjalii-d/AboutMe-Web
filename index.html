         🌼 hi again! i'm anjali—a student who's figuring things out one step, one project, and one chai latte at a time. i love thoughtful conversations, classic romcoms, and learning how the world works (especially when it comes to people, communities, and big ideas).
        </p>
        <p> 
         🕰️most of my time goes to things that let me help or create—like tutoring younger students at kumon, or leading my school's speech & debate team. i've even had the chance to speak with tennessee legislators about what students care about most, which made me realize how much our voices matter.
        </p>
        <p>
        🧠lately, i've been exploring things like finance, communication, and tech—just enough to know i want to keep learning. this little site is part of my journey through the hackclub athena award. it's something i made for myself, but i hope you enjoy it, too.
        </p>
        <p>
        ☕when i'm not doing any of that, though, you'll probably find me hanging out with my friends, rewatching “10 things i hate about you,” or perfecting my go-to latte order.
